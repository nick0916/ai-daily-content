## v15.10.0

替 Claude Code 的對話自動做記憶，此版本重點是讓使用者控制記憶擷取並提高穩定性。

**Why** 登入憑證過期會讓記憶擷取中斷，因此新增可長期使用的 token 設定。

**How** 在 ~/.claude-mem/.env 設定 CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN，並可用 CLAUDE_MEM_OBSERVER_ENABLED=false 停止新的觀察與摘要模型呼叫。

**What** v0.15.10.0 另新增 CLAUDE_MEM_PROVIDER_BY_SOURCE 依來源選擇 observer 供應商，doctor 會回報 observer 不可用，並新增 Groq、xAI、Notion、Sentry 等多種 token 的寫入前遮蔽。

### 重點
- CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN 可寫入 ~/.claude-mem/.env，登入過期後擷取不中斷；CLAUDE_MEM_OBSERVER_ENABLED=false 可停止新的模型呼叫並保留既有記憶
- CLAUDE_MEM_PROVIDER_BY_SOURCE 可依來源分別指定 observer，例如 Codex 工作階段用 Codex、Claude Code 工作階段用 Claude
- 新增 Groq、xAI、NVIDIA NIM、Linear、Notion、Sentry、Databricks 等多種 token 在儲存前遮蔽

<summary>點此展開 / 收合</summary>

What's new 
 Onboarding finds your existing work. Setup now leads with discovering your existing work, rules and focus from your transcripts. The main button is "Discover My Work, Rules & Focus", and "Skip this step" is a smaller action under it. The "Share anonymous usage statistics to help improve your Claude-mem experience" box starts checked; unchecking it is kept, and nothing is sent until you press Discover. When hosted setup is busy, claude-mem checks capacity before uploading, remembers the cooldown across restarts and lets you finish setup. ( #5270 , #5308 , #5384 by @thedotmack ) 
 Turn memory capture off. New CLAUDE_MEM_OBSERVER_ENABLED setting and a Memory capture toggle. Set it to "false" to stop new observation and summary model calls while keeping existing memories, search and session-start context. ( #5353 by @tarunbad ) 
 Pick the observer per tool. New CLAUDE_MEM_PROVIDER_BY_SOURCE setting picks the observer provider per session source, for example Codex sessions on Codex and Claude Code sessions on Claude. ( #5333 by @ankit4479 ) 
 Long-lived Claude login. ~/.claude-mem/.env can now supply CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN , so capture doesn't stop when the stored Claude Code login expires. Sessions paused for auth resume once a credential is shown to work. ( #5372 by @MeggDistribution , #5383 by @xunguangzlj-cloud ) 
 Combine modes. Mode overrides now chain, so a language mode can combine with chill, like code--chill--ko . ( #5349 by @BaeJinSeop ) 
 Doctor explains a missing observer. npx claude-mem doctor now reports an unavailable observer provider and the worker's dependencies, instead of saying all is well. ( #5366 by @parveen0029 ) 
 Viewer sync and My Work. Viewer sync recovery is now on main: faster bounded views, truthful sync status, shared My Work state between devices, and recovery of remote changes. On the cloud viewer, My Work links to Account & billing. ( #5410 , #5416 by @thedotmack ) 
 Reliability 
 
 The worker waits for a free slot instead of failing when the pool of 10 is full, and releases an idle slot when other sessions are waiting. ( #5386 by @balabommablock-cpu , #5388 by @0xABCD01 ) 
 Hung context-reader requests now time out, so a stuck read no longer stops observations. ( #5387 by @markjoin123 ) 
 Failure tracking restarts when the kind of failure changes. ( #5380 by @xunguangzlj-cloud ) 
 Codex exits are classified only from their recent stderr. ( #5310 by @2023Anita ) 
 The observer no longer inherits a parent gateway's model names, and keeps your Claude beta opt-out. A model refusal is reported as a model outage. ( #5316 by @sayedrisat , #5317 by @parveen0029 , #5348 by @tarunbad ) 
 SSE streams keep their framing across chunk boundaries, and the viewer ignores frames it can't parse. ( #5367 by @Afloat16 , #5364 by @DeryFerd ) 
 Capped error-body readers release their locks. ( #5340 by @Afloat16 ) 
 Bug reports fall back to the template when the SDK doesn't finish a report. ( #5302 by @liuyinchu ) 
 
 Install and platforms 
 
 Windows: the worker daemon starts without PowerShell. ( #5351 by @REI-330 ) 
 Copilot CLI: the MCP server is registered in ~/.copilot/mcp-config.json , where Copilot CLI reads it. ( #5305 by @tanishqbaweja ) 
 Goose on Windows: claude-mem is registered in %APPDATA%\Block\goose\config . ( #5323 by @tanishqbaweja ) 
 Devin: context is injected again after Devin compacts a session. ( #5314 by @patrickballard ) 
 Kimi: hook commands stay valid TOML when a path contains a quote. ( #5363 by @DeryFerd ) 
 Docker: the server and worker share the same BullMQ queue prefix, and the docs list tested Redis-compatible servers. The sync-api container runs as a non-root user. ( #5389 , #5390 by @murtazayusuf , #5331 by @DeryFerd ) 
 Process identity probes are pinned to UTC. ( #5312 by @LuckVd ) 
 
 Import and search 
 
 Prompt import reads the Codex and OpenCode profiles set by CODEX_HOME and XDG_DATA_HOME , includes committed OpenCode WAL updates, recognizes OpenCode tool inputs as agent-authored, excludes copied Codex fork prompts, decodes JSON tool strings, and keeps hook prompts when session reads are incomplete. ( #5303 , #5297 , #5304 , #5300 , #5369 , #5301 by @rudycelekli ) 
 Adoption keeps the real checkout paths before remapping memories, and checkout identity keeps whitespace. ( #5296 by @rudycelekli , #5368 by @liuyinchu ) 
 Folder searches match relative backslash paths and extensionless files like Makefile . ( #5309 by @rudycelekli , #5343 by @liuyinchu ) 
 Chroma's semantic fallback query no longer includes doc_type . ( #5355 by @0xABCD01 ) 
 Compact times handle the U+202F separator before AM/PM. ( #5356 by @kevin9327 ) 
 
 Privacy and security 
 
 More secrets are redacted before they are stored: Groq, xAI, NVIDIA NIM, Runcrate, Google OAuth ( ya29. ), Linear, Notion, Supabase, Sentry, Databricks and HashiCorp Vault tokens. ( #5298 , #5342 , #5345 , #5352 , #5373 by @kevin9327 ; #5327 by @DeryFerd ) 
 Log values with line breaks are escaped so they can't forge a log record. ( #5328 by @DeryFerd ) 
 Sync: a 402 verify response drops the cached verdict, the per-isolate auth memo is bounded, and advisory sockets close when their auth verdict lapses. ( #5329 , #5332 by @DeryFerd ; #5358 by @REI-330 ) 
 Input bounds on batch id arrays, timeline depth, the job listing offset and empty URL modifiers; numeric-string ids are accepted in /api/observations/batch . ( #5360 , #5362 , #5361 , #5330 by @DeryFerd ; #5341 by @Afloat16 ; #5336 by @ryrenz ) 
 Hermes strips memory tags with a linear scan. ( #5320 by @REI-330 ) 
 
 Docs 
 
 Development prerequisites and test instructions match current tooling; the README lists every built-in language mode; Simplified Chinese and Vietnamese READMEs are synced. ( #5324 by @POWDER-RANGER , #5334 by @BaeJinSeop , #5322 by @h6rime , #5391 by @vietmy1711 ) 
 Test fix for macOS SQLite. ( #5313 by @patrickballard ) 
 
 Thank you to everyone who contributed to this release.
